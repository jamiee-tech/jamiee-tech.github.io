This collage took me around five hours to complete, but the journey was anything but simple. It all started with a prompt to create a collage using 100 different objects or photos based on something I’m passionate about. The examples I was given ranged from logos to specific football players, each offering a unique challenge. I decided to focus on anime and cartoon characters, thinking it wouldn't be too difficult to find 100 different ones. But, as the process unfolded, I quickly realized just how tricky it could be.

Each layer of the collage represented a different character, and getting the proportions just right was no small feat. The first 50-70 characters were relatively easy to figure out, but it was the final stretch that stumped me. My mind kept drawing blanks, and I wasn’t sure how to wrap it up. That’s when my friends came to the rescue, suggesting their favorite characters. Their involvement made the whole process feel even more meaningful, knowing their interests were woven into the collage. It became a personal, collaborative piece in a way I hadn't expected.

The collage also turned into a bit of a “Where’s Waldo” challenge, as I kept trying to pick out who was in the piece and who wasn’t. It’s fun to look back on now, and despite the time and patience it took, this collage ended up being one of my favorites to make. It taught me the value of persistence, creativity, and the joy of working with others.
