## A question can have many solutions but theres only one correct answer

Math and coding share a challenge: both are difficult, but solutions exist. When faced with problems, we often reach out for help. However, the quality of the help we get depends on the clarity and specificity of our question. Simply showing your code and expecting a fix might result in vague answers, incorrect solutions, or no response at all.

In coding, many rely on others for insights, often turning to StackOverflow. It's a platform where users can post questions and receive help on fixing or improving their code.

## What’s a "stupid" question?

StackOverflow is an invaluable resource for programmers who need help with code or want to learn new methods. However, some questions are poorly framed and less likely to get useful answers. Here's an example of a "stupid" question:

```
Q:why doesn't my sorted code work in c? 

Here is my code. it doesn't work:

void insertioon (int d)   // this part, insert and sort list
{                     
    struct node *np, *temp, *prev;
    int found;

    np=malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    np->data = d;
    np->nextPtr = NULL;

    temp=firstPtr;
    found=0;
    while ((temp != NULL) && !found)
    {

        if (temp->data <d)
        {
            prev = temp;
            temp = temp->nextPtr;
        }
        else
        {
            found=1;
        }

        if (prev == NULL)
        {
            np->nextPtr=firstPtr;
            firstPtr=np;
        }
        else
        {
            prev->nextPtr = np;
            np->nextPtr = temp;
        }
    }
}

What is my mistake ? in insertioon , I want to sort this list.
```

While the heading indicates the issue (sorting), the question lacks details on what’s specifically wrong, leaving too much for the responder to figure out. It feels like minimal effort was made in troubleshooting before asking for help, which often leads to incomplete or unhelpful responses. They don’t specify what’s wrong with their code and just throw it out there, expecting someone to fix it—almost like casting a line with poor bait and hoping for a big catch.

## The better question.

Now, consider this more thoughtful question:

```
Q: why is casting from an unsigned int to a struct that consists of bitfields making up an unsigned int not allowed?


I have looked at the recommendations for both my question and searched for my question's headline but did not find anything related. The line I am confused about is below the comments in mmu.c. I want to set up the MMU translation table on an ARM v7 32-bit processor. The function void map_virt_to_phys_adr(uint32_t virt_adr, uint32_t phys_adr, uint32_t AP, uint32_t PXN, uint32_t XN) takes both the virtual and physical address as parameters and permission flags. It simply creates an entry in the translation table that has the offset of the physical/virtual address (they need to be the same). I do not understand why the compiler gives the errors: a cast from the (L1_table_entry) (section_base_adr | (phys_adr & L1_table_index)) to L1_table_index is not allowed (there is no explanation). And why it says that a ')' is expected at L1_table_index in (phys_adr & L1_table_index)).

// mmu.h
#define L1_section_index ((uint32_t)1 << (21)) - 1;
#define L1_table_index ~L1_section_index;

typedef struct L1_table_entry{
    uint32_t PXN:1;
    uint32_t unused_1:3;
    uint32_t XN:1;
    uint32_t DOMAIN:4;
    uint32_t unused:1;
    uint32_t AP_0_1:2;
    uint32_t unused_2:3;
    uint32_t AP_2:1;
    uint32_t unused_3:4;
    uint32_t base_address:12;
}L1_table_entry;

typedef struct L1_fault_entry{
    uint32_t fault:2;
    uint32_t unused:30;
}L1_fault_entry;

enum MMU_entry_type {L1_ENTRY, L1_FAULT};

typedef struct MMU_entry{
    union {
        L1_table_entry L1_entry;
        L1_fault_entry L1_fault_entry;
    };
    enum MMU_entry_type type;
} MMU_entry;

// ...
//mmu.c

void map_virt_to_phys_adr(uint32_t virt_adr, uint32_t phys_adr, uint32_t AP, uint32_t PXN, uint32_t XN){
    uint32_t section_index = virt_adr & L1_section_index;
    uint32_t table_index = virt_adr & L1_table_index;
    uint32_t section_base_adr = phys_adr & L1_table_index;
    // cast to L1_table_entry is not allowed. Expected a ')' at L1_table_index.
    L1_table_entry =  (L1_table_entry) (section_base_adr | (phys_adr & L1_table_index));
    L1_table[table_index] = phys_adr & L1_table_index;
}
Edit: I am interested in the reasons for the errors and a solution :)
```

This question provides a clear explanation of the problem, the code, and the error, showing the effort made to understand the issue before reaching out for help. It also includes details about the desired outcome and the context, which helps responders provide better guidance.

## Conclusion

Smart questions—those that are clear, concise, and show effort—invite productive responses, foster learning, and contribute to a collaborative atmosphere in the developer community. Poorly framed questions, on the other hand, waste time and hinder the learning process for everyone involved.

By learning how to ask questions effectively, developers can improve their technical communication and help build a more vibrant, efficient, and helpful community.
