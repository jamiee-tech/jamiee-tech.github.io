## UI Frameworks are fun.

As someone who’s always had a passion for graphic design, I’ve found UI development to be a perfect blend of creativity and coding. It’s like combining the artistic freedom of design with the logic of programming. UI code, especially when working with frameworks like Bootstrap, feels similar to tools like Canva, where you can use pre-made components and templates to jump-start a project. This makes it easy to implement your own style while saving time. However, just like Canva sometimes limits the diversity of design elements, UI frameworks can feel a bit restrictive when it comes to creative flexibility.

That’s where raw HTML and CSS shine. They’re like Photoshop—offering a blank canvas where you can build your design from scratch. With HTML and CSS, the possibilities feel endless, and you have complete freedom to experiment and create exactly what you want. This flexibility is what excites me, but it also means more time and effort are required to learn and implement everything.

## Learning curve
Learning both has been incredibly useful for me, even though the journey wasn’t always easy. I found HTML to be the trickiest to grasp at first—it took time and patience to understand all the tags, elements, and structure. However, once I got the hang of it, picking up Bootstrap felt like a natural progression. It was so much easier because it builds on the foundations of HTML and CSS, and it simplifies many of the complexities I encountered earlier.

There’s also the time factor. When I compiled my own raw HTML and CSS code, it often took longer to render and test on my computer. In hindsight, using Bootstrap was definitely a time-saver, since it streamlines a lot of the tedious aspects of web development.

## Conclusion
Overall, diving into website creation and learning how to design has been a fun and rewarding experience. It’s been exciting, especially because one of my coworkers does web development too, so we get to share our insights and experiences. With a solid understanding of UI design, I feel even more motivated to keep pushing myself and explore the limitless world of web design. The combination of creativity and technical skills has opened up a new path for me that I can’t wait to continue exploring.
